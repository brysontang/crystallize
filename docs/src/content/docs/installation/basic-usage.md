Explicitly provide users explicitly with immediate satisfaction clearly through a quick test explicitly demonstrating basic functionality explicitly right after installation explicitly. Clearly instruct users explicitly to create explicitly a minimal file explicitly (e.g.,Â `minimal_experiment.py`) explicitly containing explicitly the simplest possible explicit working experiment explicitly.

Explicitly instruct clearly how to explicitly execute explicitly the minimal example explicitly, explicitly indicating explicitly the expected output explicitly. Clearly guide users explicitly through a quick verification explicitly of successful installation explicitly, explicitly verifying explicit functionality clearly right after explicit setup explicitly.
