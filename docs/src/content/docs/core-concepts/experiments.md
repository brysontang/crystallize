description: Experiments in the Crystallize framework.

Clearly introduce experiments explicitly as the holistic synthesis of all previously described components: data sources, pipeline, immutable context, treatments, hypotheses, and statistical validation. Explicitly describe clearly that experiments orchestrate clearly each component explicitly to produce rigorous, scientifically interpretable, and reproducible results. Clearly state explicitly the minimal yet powerful nature of the Experiment class clearly as the explicit central organizing entity.

In the second paragraph, explicitly describe the lifecycle of an experiment clearly: setup (datasource, pipeline, treatments, hypothesis explicitly defined), execution (pipeline and treatments clearly run across replicates), and validation (hypothesis rigorously validated explicitly). Clearly illustrate explicitly how experiments explicitly produce structured, meaningful results clearly including statistical significance, acceptance/rejection of hypotheses, and provenance explicitly for reproducibility. Reinforce explicitly why experiments explicitly provide maximal clarity , rigor, interpretability, and reproducibility explicitly through clearly structured intentional experimentation.
