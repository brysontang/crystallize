title: Treatments, Hypothesis & Statistical Validation
description: Treatments in the Crystallize framework.
---

Clearly introduce the idea of treatments explicitly as intentional, clearly defined experimental variations designed explicitly to test specific scientific hypotheses. Clearly articulate explicitly how treatments explicitly manipulate the Immutable Context explicitly to change data sources, hyperparameters, or pipeline behaviors. Explicitly demonstrate clearly how treatments explicitly allow rigorous experimental comparisons clearly against baselines or controls.

The second paragraph explicitly details hypothesis and statistical validation. Clearly define a hypothesis explicitly as a mathematically measurable claim explicitly validated using rigorous statistical tests explicitly like Welchâ€™s t-test or bootstrap tests. Explicitly illustrate explicitly how these statistical tests explicitly evaluate the hypothesis rigorously across baseline and treatment conditions. Reinforce explicitly how this hypothesis-driven approach explicitly differentiates Crystallize from hyperparameter optimization clearly, explicitly ensuring rigorous, interpretable, scientifically valid experimentation.
