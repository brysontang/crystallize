title: Pipelines & Pipeline Steps
description: Pipelines in the Crystallize framework.
---

Clearly define pipelines explicitly as sequences of steps that transform, measure, or analyze data, emphasizing pipelines explicitly as the primary mechanism of data transformation. Explicitly describe pipeline steps as small, composable units designed for maximum clarity and minimal complexity. Clearly explain each pipeline step explicitly returns data to the next step, creating an explicit chain of clear, reproducible transformations.

The second paragraph explicitly demonstrates clearly defining pipeline steps by extending the `PipelineStep` abstract class. Clearly articulate that each step explicitly implements a simple callable interface, receiving data and context explicitly, then explicitly returning transformed data or metrics. Reinforce explicitly that this minimalistic design explicitly ensures maximal clarity, flexibility, and reproducibility, empowering users clearly without complex abstraction overhead.
