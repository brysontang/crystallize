title: Immutable Context
description: Immutable context in the Crystallize framework.
---

Explicitly introduce the Immutable Context clearly as the primary mechanism for experiment reproducibility and state management. Clearly explain explicitly that the Immutable Context is passed clearly between pipeline steps and treatments, explicitly ensuring consistent state throughout each experiment run. Clearly illustrate explicitly how immutability explicitly prevents accidental state changes and explicitly enables caching and provenance tracking.

In the second paragraph, explicitly detail how the context explicitly stores relevant state information (treatment names, replicate numbers, file paths, hyperparameters). Explicitly explain how this immutability clearly enables powerful caching and provenance tracking, clearly ensuring experiments can always be explicitly reproduced precisely. Reinforce explicitly how context immutability explicitly simplifies experiment logic clearly by providing reliable, explicit state management with rigorous reproducibility.
