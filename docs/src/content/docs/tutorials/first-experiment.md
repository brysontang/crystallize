title: Your First Experiment
description: First experiment in the Crystallize framework.
---

Explicitly present a minimal yet complete experiment clearly designed for first-time users to experience immediate success and clarity. This tutorial explicitly guides users step-by-step through setting up a trivial yet fully functional experiment clearly: explicitly defining a basic data source returning a small list or synthetic data, explicitly writing a single pipeline step (such as an identity or simple transform), explicitly creating a trivial hypothesis clearly verifiable through simple means (e.g., checking if a number increases), explicitly running the experiment clearly, and explicitly interpreting the straightforward results explicitly. Clearly show complete copy-and-paste-ready code snippets explicitly, ensuring that each step is clearly understandable, self-contained, and elegant in its simplicity.

The second paragraph explicitly highlights clearly the importance of each minimal step explicitly, reinforcing explicitly why this structure explicitly works the way it does. Clearly point out explicitly the output, explicitly guiding the user to interpret the statistical significance and hypothesis clearly. Explicitly conclude by clearly directing users forward, explicitly indicating that the power of Crystallize explicitly becomes deeply apparent in more complex scenarios explicitly covered in later tutorials. Reinforce explicitly how this minimal example clearly demonstrates the fundamental elegance, simplicity, and reproducibility explicitly at the heart of Crystallize.
