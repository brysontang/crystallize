description: Getting started with the Crystallize framework.

This page should explicitly present a brief but complete copy-paste example designed to demonstrate clearly the elegant simplicity and rigorous clarity of the Crystallize workflow. Explicitly walk the user step-by-step through defining a minimal data source, a pipeline step (e.g., identity transform), a trivial yet clear hypothesis (e.g., metric should increase), and a single trivial treatment. Explain clearly each component (Datasource, Pipeline, Hypothesis, Treatment) in just a sentence or two, ensuring the reader understands immediately what each part does, without overwhelming detail.

Explicitly show the output of running this minimal experiment, clearly pointing out what the results indicate (statistical significance, acceptance of the hypothesis). Briefly but explicitly explain how the framework rigorously validated the hypothesis, giving the reader immediate satisfaction and concrete clarity. End explicitly with a clear pointer forward: "This minimal example barely scratches the surface; continue onward to understand deeply how Crystallize empowers rigorous, reproducible, scientific experimentation in real-world scenarios." This clearly motivates users to continue exploring the docs.
