title: Why Crystallize?
description: Why Crystallize?
---

This page explicitly addresses the "why" behind the creation of Crystallize, clearly differentiating it from traditional data science frameworks (e.g., DAG frameworks like Airflow or pipeline frameworks like scikit-learn) and from hyperparameter tuning tools (e.g., Optuna or GridSearch). It must clearly state that Crystallize is explicitly **not** a hyperparameter tuning tool or a general-purpose DAG workflow engine, but rather an intentionally crafted framework for rigorous, scientific hypothesis verification. Provide a direct, explicit side-by-side comparison table clearly highlighting differences: purpose (optimization vs. hypothesis testing), process (random search vs. structured experimentation), and outcomes (best parameters vs. validated scientific insights).

Explicitly illustrate, through brief practical scenarios, why existing tools fall short of providing a rigorous, reproducible, scientifically transparent workflow. For example, clearly explain how hyperparameter tuning often leads to brittle results and hidden assumptions, whereas Crystallize explicitly makes these assumptions testable and clear. Reinforce that Crystallize exists explicitly to bring rigor, reproducibility, and scientific integrity to the forefront of experimentation in machine learning and data science, providing both practical value and philosophical alignment with core scientific principles.
