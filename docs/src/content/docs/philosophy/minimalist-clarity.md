title: Minimalist Clarity & Extensibility
description: Minimalist clarity in the Crystallize framework.
---

This page explicitly defines the principle of minimalist clarity as it applies to Crystallize, clearly explaining that the framework deliberately avoids unnecessary complexity, abstraction overhead, or opaque constructs. Explicitly illustrate the key design choice clearly made: minimal core abstractions (Datasource, PipelineStep, Hypothesis, Treatment), clearly structured to be simple yet powerful enough to handle diverse experimental workflows. Clearly highlight that minimalism in Crystallize explicitly enhances clarity, empowering users rather than constraining them.

The second paragraph explicitly addresses extensibility, clearly explaining how the minimal core abstractions intentionally enable flexible and intuitive extension. Explicitly articulate that minimalism is not limiting; rather, it empowers explicit creativity. Clearly explain that users can easily define new data sources, pipeline steps, or statistical tests without fighting complex inheritance hierarchies or rigid interfaces. Explicitly emphasize the philosophical benefit of minimalism clearly: users spend less time learning complex APIs and more time designing rigorous, meaningful experiments. Reinforce that Crystallize explicitly believes great frameworks minimize complexity, explicitly maximizing clarity and creativity.
